Recommended Books

•	Gödel, Escher, Bach : An Eternal Golden Braid by Douglas R. Hofstadter

A classic, poetic, philosophical defense of AI.

•	Machines Who Think by Pamela McCorduck.

A good review of early AI history.

•	Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind by Hans P. Moravec

Somewhat hyped book by a CMU robotics researcher.

•	Flesh and Machines: How Robots Will Change Us by Rodney Allen Brooks

Reasonably decent book by MIT's leading robotics researcher.

•	Wired for War by Peter Warren Singer

Reviews growing use of robots and unmanned vehicles in warfare.

•	Behind Deep Blue: Building the Computer That Defeated the World Chess Champion by Feng-Hsiung Hsu 

Autobiographical book on the development of a history making game-playing system. Interesting personal story of the hard engineering work that went into the system, with a few interesting facts on the technical aspects.

•	The Age of Spiritual Machines : When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence by Ray Kurzweil

A recent view by an AI entrepreneur that has content if you ignore all the hype and overly-optimistic trust that Moore's law will magically solve all of the major problems.

•	Hal's Legacy : 2001's Computer As Dream and Reality 

An interesting collection of edited articles written to celebrate the fictional birthday of a famous intelligent computer who's true birthday must unfortunately be delayed, pending AI's inevitable progress.

•	The Sciences of the Artificial by Herbert Simon

AI as science by one of its founders.

•	Models of My Life by Herbert Simon.

An autobiography of one of AI's founders who's intellectual contributions also include fundamental contributions to economics (for which he won the Nobel prize), cognitive psychology, and computer science (such as co-inventing the linked list in the 1950's).

•	Alan Turing: The Enigma by Alan Hodges.

A biography of one of the founders of CS and originator of the Turing test. Also a testimony to the tragic implications of homophobia.

•	The Emperor's New Mind : Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics and Shadows of the Mind : A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness and The Large, the Small and the Human Mind by Roger Penrose

A completely bogus argument against AI by a hopelessly Platonic mathematician. The last book contains an appended article by Stephen Hawking (a colleague of Penrose's) who of course doesn't buy his bogus argument.

•	The Mind's New Science : A History of the Cognitive Revolution by Howard Gardner

A nice history of the development of cognitive science.

•	How the Mind Works , The Language Instinct , and Words and Rules : The Ingredients of Language by Steven Pinker

Fun reading on lots of interesting issues in modern Cognitive Science and Linguistics if you don't take his exaggerated beliefs in nativism and evolutionary psychology too seriously.

•	Bots : The Origin of New Species by Andrew Leonard

A light, somewhat hyped book on on Internet agents, chatterbots, etc. with a few funny stories.

•	Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty by Morris Kline

A very nice book on the failed enterprise of using logic to build a firm foundation for infallible mathematics and the role of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem in the philosophy of mathematics.

•	Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Gödel by Rebecca Goldstein

An interesting biography of Kurt Gödel. Too bad he was such a Platonist that, unlike Turing, he did not understand the true implications of his own theorems (interesting author connection: Goldstein is Pinker's wife).
